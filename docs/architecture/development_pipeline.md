## 1. Overview

The DevOS development pipeline is the complete path from an idea to a completed, governed change in the codebase.

```
Idea
         ↓
Planning System                    ← EXTERNAL (gstack / Linear / GitHub Issues / any task system)
  (epics / stories / tasks)
         ↓
Task selection                     ← human or external automation
         ↓
change_intent.yaml                 ← entry point into DevOS
         ↓
DevOS Governance Kernel            ← DevOS boundary begins here
  Run initialization
         ↓
Workflow execution
  (INIT → PLANNING → ARCH_CHECK → TEST_DESIGN
   → BRANCH_READY → IMPLEMENTING → TESTING → REVIEWING)
         ↓
Planning Artifact                  ← produced by agent_planner
         ↓
Implementation                     ← produced by agent_implementer
         ↓
Review                             ← produced by agent_reviewer
         ↓
ACCEPTED                           ← terminal state, run complete
```

**Planning always comes from external tools.** DevOS does not define what should be built. It governs how approved, scoped work items progress through a disciplined execution workflow.

Every stage in this pipeline has explicit inputs, explicit outputs, and a defined responsibility. Nothing passes between stages except through artifacts.

---

## 2. Stage 1 — Idea and Planning

**Outside DevOS boundary.**

Development begins with an idea. The idea is captured in a planning system as a work item.

Planning systems may include:
- Linear
- GitHub Issues
- gstack
- A local project plan YAML

The planning system breaks work down into epics, stories, and tasks. This work is done by a human or a planning agent operating outside the DevOS kernel.

**Output of this stage**: A selected, scoped task ready to be executed.

---

## 3. Stage 2 — Change Intent Authoring

**Entry point into DevOS.**

The selected task is converted into a `change_intent.yaml` file. This conversion is the bridge between the planning layer and the DevOS governance kernel.

The `change_intent.yaml` specifies:
- the objective of the change
- the scope and constraints
- relevant domain references

It does not contain implementation decisions. Those are produced in the planning stage of the workflow.

**Artifact produced**: `change_intent.yaml`

**Schema**: `framework/artifacts/schemas/change_intent.schema.yaml`

The `agent_work_item_author` role may assist in producing this artifact from a human brief or planning system output. See `framework/agents/agent_work_item_author.md`.

---

## 4. Stage 3 — DevOS Run Initialization

**DevOS kernel takes control.**

```bash
devos run --intent change_intent.yaml
```

The CLI:
1. assigns a deterministic `run_id`
2. creates the run directory at `runs/<run_id>/`
3. copies `change_intent.yaml` into the artifact store
4. loads the workflow definition
5. records a `run.initialized` event
6. sets the initial workflow state to `INIT`

From this point, the run directory is the canonical state of the work. All subsequent actions are recorded there.

---

## 5. Stage 4 — Workflow Execution

The workflow advances through states. Each state is the responsibility of a defined agent role. Each transition requires gate validation to pass.

### PLANNING state

**Responsible agent**: `agent_planner`

The planner reads `change_intent.yaml` and all domain context files. It produces:

- `implementation_plan.yaml` — structured, scoped plan with explicit steps
- `design_tradeoffs.md` — explicit assumptions and trade-off decisions

**Gate requirements**: Both artifacts must be present, structurally valid, and approved via `decision_log.yaml`.

---

### ARCH_CHECK state

**Responsible agent**: `agent_architecture_guardian`

The architecture guardian reviews the implementation plan against the project's `architecture_contract.md`. It produces:

- `arch_review_record.md` with `outcome: PASS` or `outcome: CHANGE_REQUIRED`

If `CHANGE_REQUIRED`:
- an `architecture_change_proposal.md` must be produced
- the proposal must be approved
- a new `arch_review_record.md` with `outcome: PASS` must be produced

**Gate requirement**: `arch_review_record.md` must have `outcome: PASS`.

---

### TEST_DESIGN state

**Responsible agent**: `agent_test_designer`

The test designer defines the test strategy before implementation begins. It produces:

- `test_design.yaml` — test cases, coverage requirements, and test strategy

Tests are designed before code is written. This is intentional.

**Gate requirement**: `test_design.yaml` must be present and approved.

---

### BRANCH_READY state

**Responsible agent**: `agent_branch_manager`

The branch manager creates an isolated change surface (e.g., a Git branch or worktree). It produces:

- `branch_status.md` — records the base reference, branch identifier, and preparation steps

**Gate requirement**: `branch_status.md` must be present and approved.

---

### IMPLEMENTING state

**Responsible agent**: `agent_implementer`

The implementer writes the code changes according to the approved plan. It produces:

- `implementation_summary.md` — maps every change to a plan item, records deviations explicitly

The implementer must not broaden scope beyond `change_intent.yaml`. Architecture changes require a proposal and approval before code is written.

**Gate requirement**: `implementation_summary.md` must be present and approved.

---

### TESTING state

**Responsible agent**: `agent_test_runner`

The test runner executes tests against the implementation. It produces:

- `test_report.json` — structured results with pass/fail status per test case

**Gate requirement**: `test_report.json` must be present and approved.

---

### REVIEWING state

**Responsible agent**: `agent_reviewer`

The reviewer assesses the full change: implementation quality, test coverage, architectural compliance, and technical debt. It produces:

- `review_result.md` with `outcome: PASS`, `outcome: PASS_WITH_DEBT`, or `outcome: REJECT`

**Gate requirement**: `review_result.md` must be present and approved.

---

## 6. Stage 5 — Decision and Terminal State

The run reaches a terminal state based on the review outcome and final human decision.

| Terminal state | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ACCEPTED` | Change approved; no outstanding technical debt |
| `ACCEPTED_WITH_DEBT` | Change approved; technical debt explicitly recorded and accepted |
| `FAILED` | Change rejected; a new run is required for rework |

`FAILED` is terminal. The run directory is preserved as an audit record. No rework happens inside a failed run.

All terminal states record a final `run.completed` event and optionally emit knowledge extraction trigger events.

---

## 7. Artifact Data Flow

The full artifact chain produced across a run:

```
change_intent.yaml
    → implementation_plan.yaml
    → design_tradeoffs.md
    → arch_review_record.md
    → test_design.yaml
    → branch_status.md
    → implementation_summary.md
    → test_report.json
    → review_result.md
    → run_metrics.json
```

Supporting artifacts (produced conditionally):

- `architecture_change_proposal.md` — when `ARCH_CHECK` outcome is `CHANGE_REQUIRED`
- `orchestrator_log.md` — execution trace produced by `agent_orchestrator`
- `decision_log.yaml` — append-only; records all human approvals across all stages

---

## 8. Human Decision Points

The `human_decision_authority` actor intervenes at explicit decision gates.

Decision gates require a matching approval entry in `decision_log.yaml` before the workflow can advance. The entry must contain:

- `artifact_id` — the identifier of the artifact being approved
- `artifact_hash` — the SHA-256 hash of the artifact at time of approval
- `decision` — `approve` or `reject`
- `timestamp` — ISO 8601

The kernel never infers approvals. No artifact advances past a gate without a matching decision log entry.

---

## 9. Improvement Cycle (Post-Run)

After a run reaches `ACCEPTED` or `ACCEPTED_WITH_DEBT`, an improvement cycle may be initiated as a separate run.

```
Completed run
  (run_metrics.json available)
         ↓
New improvement cycle run initialized
         ↓
OBSERVE → REFLECT → PROPOSE → HUMAN_DECISION
         ↓
(optional) new change_intent.yaml for next delivery run
```

The improvement cycle is a separate workflow with a separate `run_id`. It must be initiated explicitly by a human. It is not triggered automatically. See `docs/roadmap/future_features.md` for the future automation design.

---

## 10. Personal Toolkit Positioning

DevOS is designed to function as a **personal AI development toolkit**.

For a solo developer or small team, the pipeline coordinates:

| Category | Tools / systems |
| --- | --- |
| Planning | Linear, GitHub Issues, gstack, or a local YAML |
| Governance kernel | DevOS runtime |
| AI reasoning | Cursor agents, local LLMs, cloud models |
| Code tools | Git, editor, language toolchain |
| Verification | Pytest, Ruff, Semgrep, or equivalent |

DevOS provides discipline and traceability across these tools without requiring any of them to be integrated directly. The artifact-first model means any tool that writes a valid artifact is compatible.
